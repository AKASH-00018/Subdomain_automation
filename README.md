Automated Subdomain Discovery & Screenshot Tool üöÄ
This Python script automates the process of finding subdomains for a target domain, identifying which of them are live, and then taking screenshots of the live subdomains. It's a useful tool for reconnaissance in cybersecurity and bug bounty hunting.

‚ú® Features
Subdomain Discovery: Utilizes powerful external tools (subfinder, amass) to enumerate subdomains.

Recursive Subdomain Finding: Performs a one-level recursive search for subdomains to broaden discovery.

Duplicate Removal: Automatically processes and de-duplicates all found subdomains.

Live Subdomain Check: Uses httpx-toolkit to quickly determine which subdomains are actively responding over HTTP/S.

Progress Tracking: Provides real-time progress updates during longer tasks.

Targeted Screenshotting: Employs eyewitness to capture visual evidence of live subdomains, organizing them into a dedicated directory.

Interactive Menu: Guides the user through the different stages of the process.

üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Python üêç
Python 3.x: The script is written in Python 3.

You can download Python from python.org.

Verify your Python version:

	python3 --version
1.2  Install Python Dependencies:
    This script relies on built-in Python modules, but for future extensibility and best practice, it's good to prepare for potential external Python libraries. If a `requirements.txt` file exists in the repository, you can install any specified Python dependencies using pip:

   
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

This ensures that any future Python libraries your script might need can be easily installed by users.

2. Git ‚öôÔ∏è
Git: Essential for cloning repositories and managing version control.

Download Git from git-scm.com.

Verify Git installation:

	git --version

3. External Security Tools (Command-Line) üîí
These tools are crucial for the script's functionality and must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

a. Subfinder
A fast passive subdomain enumeration tool.

Installation (Go):

	go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest

Installation (Pre-compiled binaries): Visit the Subfinder GitHub releases page and download the appropriate binary for your OS.

b. Amass
A powerful network mapping tool that performs a variety of enumeration techniques.

Installation (Go):

	go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master

Installation (Pre-compiled binaries/others): Refer to the Amass GitHub page for detailed installation instructions.

c. Httpx-toolkit
A fast and versatile HTTP toolkit for probing websites.

Installation (Go):

	go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest

Installation (Pre-compiled binaries): Visit the Httpx GitHub releases page and download the appropriate binary for your OS.

d. Eyewitness
A tool to take screenshots of websites, provide HTTP headers, and identify default credentials if possible.

Installation (Clone and install dependencies):

	git clone https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness.git
	cd EyeWitness/Python/setup
	sudo bash setup.sh
After setup, ensure the 'EyeWitness.py' script is in your PATH,
or you'll need to specify its full path when running it.
You might consider creating a symlink:
sudo ln -s /path/to/EyeWitness/Python/EyeWitness.py /usr/local/bin/eyewitness

Note: EyeWitness typically requires webkitgtk-1.0 or webkitgtk-3.0 for screenshotting, which might need to be installed via your system's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install webkitgtk-3.0 on Debian/Ubuntu).

üöÄ Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository (or download the script):

	git clone https://github.com/AKASH-00018/Subdomain_automation
	cd subdomain-automation-tool

Ensure Script Permissions (if necessary):

	chmod +x subdomain_automator.py

üèÉ Usage
Run the script:

	python3 subdomain_automator.py

Follow the Prompts:

The script will first ask you to enter the target domain (e.g., example.com).

Then, a main menu will appear with two options:

Option 1: Subdomain Finding & Live Check

Select this to discover subdomains, filter for live ones, and save them to a file named [target_domain]_subdomains.txt.

Option 2: Screenshotting Live Subdomains

Select this to take screenshots. It will prompt you for the input file (defaulting to the one generated by Option 1) and save screenshots to a screenshots_[target_domain] directory.

Option 3: Exit

üí° How It Works (Briefly)
Subfinder & Amass: These tools are executed to perform comprehensive subdomain enumeration. subfinder is generally faster for passive lookups, while amass provides a broader range of techniques, often including active reconnaissance.

Httpx-toolkit: After collecting all potential subdomains, httpx quickly sends HTTP requests to each one to verify if they are active web servers and returns only the reachable ones.

Eyewitness: Takes the list of live subdomains and captures a visual snapshot of each website, which is invaluable for quickly assessing their content.
